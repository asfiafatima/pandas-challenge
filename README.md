# PyCity Schools Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of school performance using Python and Pandas. The analysis focuses on various factors such as school budgets, school sizes, and school types to understand their impact on test results and overall performance.

## Key Findings

- Schools with higher budgets did not necessarily yield better test results. Schools with a per-student budget in the range of $645 to $675 underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets.
- Smaller and medium-sized schools outperformed larger schools in terms of passing math performances. The passing rate for math was notably higher in these schools.
- Charter schools consistently outperformed public district schools across all metrics. Further analysis is required to determine whether this is due to school practices or the smaller student populations they serve.

## Methodology

### Data Sources

- School Data: "schools_complete.csv"
- Student Data: "students_complete.csv"

### Analysis Steps

1. Merged school and student data to create a comprehensive dataset.
2. Calculated various metrics, including average math and reading scores, passing percentages, and overall passing rates.
3. Grouped data by school type, size, and spending to analyze performance trends.

## Visualizations

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing school performance. It highlights that while higher budgets don't guarantee better results, school size and type play significant roles. Charter schools' outperformance could stem from their practices or smaller student populations.

## Next Steps

- Further investigate the reasons behind the underperformance of schools with higher budgets.
- Analyze additional factors, such as teacher-student ratios, extracurricular activities, and parental involvement.
- Consider exploring the impact of socioeconomic factors on school performance.
