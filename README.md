Based on the data presented, the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing are:
1.	Cabrera High School
2.	Thomas High School
3.	Griffin High School
4.	Wilson High School
5.	Pena High School
All five schools are charter schools, suggesting that charter schools may generally perform better than district schools. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between higher per student budgets and higher overall passing rates, as all five schools have per student budgets above $578.
The analysis shows that smaller schools, with fewer than 1,000 students, have the highest overall passing rates (89.9%) compared to medium-sized schools (90.6%) and large schools (58.3%). Large schools, with over 2,000 students, have the lowest overall passing rates compared to smaller and medium-sized schools.
Another conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis is that there is not a significant difference in the average math and reading scores between the different size categories. The average math and reading scores are similar for all three size categories, with the smallest difference being between small and medium-sized schools.
These conclusions are important for understanding the relationship between school size and performance, which can help inform decisions regarding school funding and resource allocation. It suggests that smaller schools may have an advantage in terms of student achievement and that schools with larger student populations may need additional support to improve overall academic performance.
This report analyzes the academic performance of schools in a large school district. Using data on student scores, school budgets, and other factors, I have examined the factors that contribute to academic success.
My analysis has identified several key findings. First, I found that schools with higher per-student budgets tend to have better academic outcomes, as measured by both math and reading scores. Specifically, schools with per-student budgets over $600 consistently outperform schools with lower budgets.
Second, I found that charter schools in the district have higher academic performance than district schools. On average, charter schools have math and reading scores that are 10% higher than district schools, and they also have higher rates of students passing both math and reading exams.
In conclusion, my analysis suggests that funding and school type are important factors that impact academic performance in this school district. Schools with higher per-student budgets and those that are chartered tend to have better academic outcomes. These findings suggest that the district could improve academic outcomes by increasing funding for schools and potentially expanding the number of charter schools in the district
